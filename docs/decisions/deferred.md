# Deferred implementation decisions

These choices are deliberately left to implementation work. Implementations
must stay within the linked settled architecture and record choices where they
become durable project constraints.

1. Cargo workspace, crate, and module layout.
2. PostgreSQL Rust client, migration framework, and concrete SQL types.
3. Exact capacities for processor channels, orphan and VSPC pending memory,
   caches, DependencyResolver and RPC concurrency, delta history, and HTTP
   work. Local RPC scheduling and batching remain implementation choices only
   where the focused architecture does not fix request boundaries or batch
   semantics. Moka is the current cache-library candidate.
4. Orphan occupancy threshold within the settled range of approximately one
   quarter through one third.
5. Detailed Tokio fairness, drain, and concrete storage synchronization
   mechanics. A shared mutation lock plus per-lane mutexes is one valid shape;
   exact lock types remain an implementation choice.
6. API endpoint URLs, HTTP methods, and final wire schema. The exact graph
   response format is intentionally not chosen yet. Benchmark JSON against
   appropriate binary formats such as CBOR, MessagePack, and Protobuf across
   server construction and serialization, compression, transfer, browser
   decoding, and graph-model construction.
7. Exact `MAX_WINDOW_DEPTH` within the settled 1000-level cache bound, HTTP and
   SSE budgets, adaptive fixed-view delay curve and cap, and graph-delta
   history size. Treat traffic-share estimates and the numeric SSE-client
   limit as load-test inputs rather than fixed architecture constants.
8. Detailed historical-read cancellation and transaction mechanism around the
   acknowledged Rebuild Reset barrier. Safe transaction locking is one
   candidate; another mechanism is acceptable when it preserves the complete
   observable Reset contract.
9. Exact metrics export and labels, tracing, operational endpoints, and
   deployment layout. Required v2 observability and processing-latency
   acceptance remain settled.
10. Exhaustive parity matrix and additional fixtures beyond the required
    [verification baseline](../architecture/verification.md).
11. Shutdown timeouts and escalation policy.
Unlisted code-level choices remain implementation details only while they
preserve every settled contract and do not resolve an item in
[open.md](open.md) implicitly.

# KGI v2 architecture overview

## Scope and ownership

This document owns the system boundary, component ownership, direction of
control and data flow, and system-wide resource isolation. Shared identities
and graph terminology belong to
the [domain model](domain-model.md). Component behavior belongs to the linked
focused document.

KGI v2 covers the processing and API tiers of the Kaspa Graph Inspector Rust
rewrite. `rusty-kaspa` is the node reference. Go KGI and
`simply-kaspa-indexer` are behavioral references, not implementation
templates.

## System shape — settled

BlockProcessor/VspcProcessor ── ordered graph updates ──► ApiService
ResyncEngine ── Reset/PublishPostSeal/PublishLive controls ──► ApiService
```

Autonomous long-lived workers form a control tree. `ResyncEngine` owns both
processors and a run's `ProcessingSession`; `BlockProcessor` owns
OrphanManager and DependencyResolver. Parent components command their
children. Children report reliable faults and milestones upward. Strong
reference cycles are forbidden. `Arc<Component>` is a valid initial shape;
thin handles are not required.

Every worker serializes its local state changes in one event loop despite
concurrent inputs. Live ingestion remains subscription-based. Notifications
travel directly from NotificationRouter to the processors and never pass
through ResyncEngine.

ApiService is an in-process, read-only observer. Its work and freshness have
lower priority than processing. The [API contract](api.md) owns graph-update
loss, reload, and publication behavior.

## Responsibility boundaries — settled

| Component | Owned state and responsibility | Focused contract |
|---|---|---|
| Supervisor | Orchestration state and the strongest unsatisfied recovery obligation | [Processing lifecycle](processing-lifecycle.md) |
| NodeService | Node connectivity, validated RPC generations, and notification routing | [Node service](node-service.md) |
| StorageService | Database connectivity, validated DB generations, persistence, and caches | [Storage](storage.md) |
| ResyncEngine | Processing sessions, recovery preparation, synchronization, and phase coordination | [Processing lifecycle](processing-lifecycle.md) |
| BlockProcessor | Block admission and materialization coordination | [Block processing](block-processing.md) |
| OrphanManager | In-memory orphan topology and dependency demand | [Block processing](block-processing.md) |
| DependencyResolver | Bounded node retrieval for requested dependencies | [Block processing](block-processing.md) |
| VspcProcessor | VSPC sequencing, readiness, and coloring coordination | [VSPC processing](vspc-processing.md) |
| ApiService | HeadGraphCache, graph publication epochs, and graph API serving | [API](api.md) |

NodeService, StorageService, ResyncEngine, and Supervisor each own their
respective service, processing, or orchestration state. Published statuses are
observations of those owners, never a second source of lifecycle authority.

## Interaction rules — settled

- Lifecycle control flows from parent to child.
- Reliable faults and milestones flow from child to parent.
- Data channels connect the explicit producers and consumers shown above;
  they do not create lifecycle ownership.
- The exact validated RPC and DB generations acquired for a processing run
  stay associated with that run.
- StorageService may open, lock, and inspect an Uninitialized database before
  NodeService is Ready. Supervisor supplies the validated
  `(network_id, genesis_hash)` only for StorageService's atomic first
  initialization; the resulting network-bound Empty database is the first
  usable state.
- Before starting a processing run, Supervisor requires an exact match between
  the validated node identity and the immutable binding exposed by the
  validated DB generation. A mismatch is rejected rather than rebound or
  recovered through Rebuild.
- Processing commits precede their graph observer updates. Observer behavior
  cannot redefine processing commit semantics.
- Web is an API consumer outside the worker control tree; its behavior is
  defined in the [Web architecture](web.md).

## Resource isolation and scalability — settled

Processing has reserved database connections and execution capacity and keeps
priority over every read-only API workload. API saturation, cache reload, and
client fan-out must never block processing, silently drop a processing
notification, or turn API observer failure into processing recovery. The
[API resource contract](api.md#resource-isolation-and-saturation--settled)
owns the concrete pools, admission lanes, limits, and saturation behavior.

KGI v2 starts with one in-process ApiService and one processing stack. This
shape may later evolve into separate stateless or read-only API replicas with
appropriate cache, proxy, and database scaling; a few thousand concurrent
clients may make that separation useful. Database replication is not required
for v2. The design does not authorize multiple independent processors writing
the same database.

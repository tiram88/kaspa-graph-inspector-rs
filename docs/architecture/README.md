# KGI v2 architecture index

This document defines the current ownership boundaries and navigation for the
KGI v2 architecture. It contains no component behavior; the focused documents
below own their named contracts.

## Architecture authority

The focused architecture documents listed below collectively form the current
normative KGI v2 architecture. Each behavioral contract has one focused owner.
Accepted changes update that owner and the applicable decision register in the
same change.

The [17 September](../history/handoffs/handoff-2026-09-17.md) and
[20 September](../history/handoffs/handoff-2026-09-20.md) handoffs preserve
provenance only. They do not participate in normative precedence or resolve a
conflict with a focused owner.

## Contract conventions and scope

The repository-wide collaboration roles, reading order, and conflict rules are
defined in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md). Within architecture documents:

- text marked **settled** is a requirement;
- Rust, SQL, and message fragments fix semantic shape only and need not compile
  as written; workspace, crate, and module layout remain deferred in the
  [decision register](../decisions/deferred.md);
- mechanics not fixed by a contract remain implementation choices; and
- a conflict must be reported and resolved in the owning architecture or an
  accepted ADR, never blended silently.

The KGI v2 system boundary is defined in [overview.md](overview.md). Work listed
in [future-work.md](../future-work.md) is outside v2 until promoted by an
accepted architecture decision. Open requirements and implementation choices
are tracked separately in the [decision register](../decisions/README.md).

Legacy handoffs and earlier planning material may use these names:

| Legacy name | Current name |
|---|---|
| `NodeClient` | `NodeService` |
| `ValidatedStorageService` | `ValidatedDbClient` |
| `Cycle 1` | `PreSeal` |
| `Quiesce` | `Deactivate` |
| `check_block_materiality()` | `ValidatedDbClient::block_presence()` |
| `load_reconciliation_state()` | `ValidatedDbClient::reconciliation_snapshot()` |

Behavioral replacements are recorded in
[superseded.md](../decisions/superseded.md) and rejected proposals in
[rejected.md](../decisions/rejected.md).

## Focused documents

Each contract has one owning document; other documents link to it instead of
restating it.

| Document | Sole concern |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Architecture authority, reading order, ownership boundaries, and navigation. It contains no system behavior. |
| `overview.md` | System boundary, component ownership, process and data-flow shape, and system-wide resource isolation. |
| `domain-model.md` | Shared identities and graph vocabulary: hashes, compact IDs, coordinates, consensus order, materiality, PP boundary, and common value types. |
| `node-service.md` | Node connection lifecycle, validated RPC generations, subscriptions, notification routing, and RPC normalization. |
| `storage.md` | Database lifecycle, schema and metadata, persistent identities, transactions, caches, and PostgreSQL behavior. |
| `block-processing.md` | BlockProcessor, OrphanManager, DependencyResolver, block admission, and PP-boundary sealing behavior. |
| `vspc-processing.md` | VSPC normalization, readiness, sequencing, coloring, and VSPC-specific behavior during recovery and Live. |
| `processing-lifecycle.md` | Supervisor, recovery intent, ResyncEngine, Resync/Rebuild preparation, the common pump, Catchup and Live admission, fault policy, retries, and teardown. |
| `api.md` | In-process graph publication, API epochs and Reset, snapshots, revisions, deltas, SSE, ETags, DAA navigation, graph-window APIs, and API resource bulkheads. |
| `web.md` | Browser client behavior and presentation requirements. |
| `verification.md` | Required fixtures, integration scenarios, acceptance checks, and upstream assumptions. It references contracts without redefining them. |

## Architecture ownership map

The project-wide [single ownership policy](../../AGENTS.md#single-ownership-policy)
applies to every architecture change. The focused-document table above assigns
the sole owner for each concern. The following rules resolve boundaries within
that map:

- shared names and value semantics belong to `domain-model.md`; behavior that
  uses them belongs to the responsible component;
- a coordinating component owns cross-component ordering and lifecycle
  transitions, while each component owns its local reaction;
- `storage.md` owns transaction, durability, schema, and cache-publication
  semantics even when another component requests the operation;
- `processing-lifecycle.md` owns recovery phase changes, while the processor
  documents own processor behavior within each phase;
- `verification.md` owns verification requirements and links to the contract
  under test; and
- decision registers, handoffs, audits, and review reports have the
  non-behavioral roles assigned by `AGENTS.md` and do not become competing
  architecture owners.

## Handoff coverage map

This table records the verified dispatch of every numbered section in the
historical [20 September handoff](../history/handoffs/handoff-2026-09-20.md).
Where a section contained more than one concern, the row records the exact
split. The focused owner, rather than this historical mapping, defines current
behavior.

| Handoff section | Focused owner and dispatch rule | Cutover status |

## Coverage verification

All handoff sections §0–§21 have been checked against their dispatched
owners and the later accepted decisions incorporated during reconciliation.
Every current behavioral contract, open requirement, deferred implementation
choice, v2.1 boundary, and rejected or superseded design has an owner outside
the handoff. Local links and heading anchors in the current architecture and
decision documents have also been checked.

Two independent losslessness reviews checked the reorganization against its
pre-extraction base. Their findings were resolved before cutover, including
the final `Inconsistent` database initialization clarification.

## Cutover record

The authority cutover completed after confirming that:

1. every row in the coverage map was applied;
2. every dispatched section was checked against later accepted changes;
3. no focused document gives a handoff precedence on conflict;
4. no current contract exists only in a handoff;
5. repository cross-references and collaboration instructions identify the
   focused owners consistently; and
6. independent review confirmed that the reorganization preserved accepted
   behavior and ownership.

The focused files are therefore the normative architecture. The superseded
handoffs reside under [`docs/history/handoffs/`](../history/handoffs/) as
non-normative provenance.

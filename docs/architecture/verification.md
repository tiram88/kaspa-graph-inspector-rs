# Verification contract

## Scope and evidence rules

This document owns the minimum evidence required for the KGI v2 architecture.
It does not redefine component behavior: each requirement below links to the
focused contract whose observable result it verifies.

Use the narrowest useful test level for behavior owned by KGI, but retain
integration coverage wherever the result depends on PostgreSQL, browser graph
behavior, or a multi-worker ordering boundary. Inject clocks and jitter sources
when wall-clock behavior is under test. Upstream correctness assumptions use
the source-analysis policy below rather than executable fixtures created only
to prove rusty-kaspa behavior.

These obligations are the required baseline. Additional matrix breadth belongs
to the [deferred decision register](../decisions/deferred.md).

## Pinned Upstream Assumption Review policy

The **Pinned Upstream Assumption Review**, abbreviated **PUAR**, is the specific
source analysis of KGI's upstream correctness assumptions against one exact
rusty-kaspa commit. The current pinned reference revision is:

```text
c338d495bec29e4dc8b5149f99e8db6fa916ed4a
```

This pin makes the architecture analysis reproducible. It identifies the
rusty-kaspa source used to assess KGI's assumptions; it is not a runtime
version restriction. KGI may connect to other node versions after ordinary
validation, but the PUAR provides no correctness claim for those versions or
for custom builds.

The PUAR checklist is:

1. For [Genesis discovery](node-service.md#genesis-discovery),
   `GetBlocks(None, false, false)` returns the configured Genesis hash first and
   returns no blocks.
2. For the NodeService
   [individual recovery GetBlock](node-service.md#individual-recovery-getblock)
   used by [Resync preparation](processing-lifecycle.md#resync-preparation),
   header-only `GetBlock` supplies the required GhostDAG data and establishes
   that the returned block is recognized as a GetBlocks low hash.
3. For the NodeService
   [GetBlocks normalization](node-service.md#getblocks-and-vspc-recovery-responses)
   used by the [Catchup trigger](processing-lifecycle.md#catchup-trigger), the
   `L + 1` GetBlocks core budget, consensus-topological ordering, page
   construction, global-maximum fallback premise, and the `< 3` normalized
   length sink-reaching premise match the design.
4. For [notification routing](node-service.md#notificationrouter) and
   [VSPC change semantics](vspc-processing.md#change-semantics--settled),
   virtual selected-sink behavior preserves the documented removed/added
   ordering, excludes changes with a nonempty removed chain and an empty added
   path, can emit the documented fully empty no-op, and never places Genesis in
   `added` or `removed`.
5. For [notification routing](node-service.md#notificationrouter) and
   [block overlap](block-processing.md#catchup-filtering-and-overlap),
   BlockAdded duplicate and verbose-data behavior matches those contracts,
   including the enrichment-failure form without verbose data.
6. For NodeService
   [consensus parameter resolution](node-service.md#consensus-parameter-resolution),
   exact-network, unsupported-testnet fallback, and devnet/simnet override
   resolution produce the documented local `bps`, `mergeset_size_limit`, and
   `anticone_finalization_depth` values. The review records that RPC exposes no
   comparison with the node's effective overrides; it does not describe these
   local values as node-validated.
7. For NodeService
   [RPC normalization](node-service.md#getblocks-and-vspc-recovery-responses),
   VSPC V2 with `min_confirmation_count = None` and
   `RpcDataVerbosityLevel::None` preserves the documented batching, complete
   removed suffix, minimal acceptance-data envelope, complete-prefix
   shortening, and advancing cursor behavior.
8. For [VSPC path attribution](vspc-processing.md#readiness-and-materiality--settled),
   a valid retained-range VSPC query emits adjacent chain-path members using
   the same GhostDAG selected-parent relation that enriched GetBlock exposes.

For each item, inspect the committed source at the full SHA and report one of:

```text
Confirmed
Not confirmed
Contradicted
```

Each result contains a concise conclusion, relevant rusty-kaspa paths and
symbols, and any material KGI impact or limitation. A PUAR is evidence about
the reference revision rather than proof across node versions. No fixture or
test is required solely to establish an upstream checklist item. Executable
tests remain required for KGI's handling of valid input and observable
violations.

The instruction **Run the Pinned Upstream Assumption Review** runs the complete
checklist against the current reference revision. **Run a PUAR against
rusty-kaspa `<full-sha>`** selects an explicit revision. The resulting dated,
non-normative report belongs in:

```text
docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-rusty-kaspa-<short-sha>-assumptions.md
```

A report does not change the reference pin or architecture automatically.
`Not confirmed` or `Contradicted` is reported to Architecture before dependent
implementation proceeds. Changing the reference revision requires a new PUAR;
otherwise repeat the review only when a compatibility problem or relevant
upstream change gives a concrete reason.

### Current PUAR result

Architecture accepts the
[24 September 2026 PUAR](../reviews/2026-09-24-rusty-kaspa-c338d495-assumptions.md)
against the full pinned revision above. All eight checklist items are
`Confirmed`; none is `Not confirmed` or `Contradicted`. The focused contracts
may therefore rely on those reviewed upstream behaviors for the pinned
revision, subject to their stated KGI validation and recovery rules.

This section is the sole normative owner of the PUAR acceptance status. The
report remains non-normative source analysis evidence. The accepted result does
not extend to another rusty-kaspa revision, a custom build, or a connected
node's undisclosed effective overrides.

### Accepted unverified upstream risk: stale-tip enumeration

The exact stale-body-tip enumeration boundary of GetBlocks is deliberately not
a PUAR checklist item. Whether lowering `low_hash` can expose every stored tip
outside the current Virtual traversal is an accepted unverified upstream risk.
The [recovery scope](processing-lifecycle.md#recovery-scope-and-omitted-body-tips)
does not claim body-DAG snapshot completeness or make Live admission depend on
that behavior, so a PUAR report need not assess this premise.

## NodeService and RPC behavior

Verify the [NodeService contract](node-service.md#nodeservice--settled) and
[RPC normalization](node-service.md#rpc-normalization) with:

1. Common full-block normalization produces the flattened
   `ValidatedNodeBlock` and rejects missing header or verbose data, inconsistent
   hashes, duplicate direct parents, contradictory self-reference, and an
   ordinary selected parent absent from the direct parents. Cover the exact
   validated-Genesis ORIGIN exception and its mandatory zero blue score
   separately.
2. GetBlocks fixtures cover the inclusive low hash, unequal hash/block vector
   lengths, hash/block disagreement, duplicates, a valid response that
   normalizes to zero blocks, and a page with one invalid full-block member.
   For every malformed recovery shape, assert typed whole-page rejection, no
   cursor or processor advancement, and retirement of the exact RPC
   generation.
3. Genesis discovery request construction with `low_hash = None`, blocks and
   transactions disabled, plus response validation for a nonempty hash vector,
   empty block vector, transport failure, and malformed output. Given a valid
   response, NodeService uses its first hash without substituting a local
   Genesis constant.
4. Consensus parameter resolution uses exact `NetworkId` parameters when
   supported. Mainnet emits no divergence warning. Every non-mainnet profile,
   including supported testnet and simnet, warns with the exact network,
   parameter source, and all four selected values, then continues. An
   unsupported testnet suffix uses testnet-family defaults. Devnet and simnet
   without `--override-params-file` use their defaults; with the option they
   parse and apply rusty-kaspa `OverrideParams`. An unreadable, malformed, or
   incompatible explicit file and use of the option with mainnet or any
   testnet suffix fail configuration without fallback. No path represents the
   selected local values as having been compared with the node. Before any
   derived rusty-kaspa call, cover accepted target-time bounds `1` and `1000`,
   rejected values `0` and `1001`, the accepted minimum merge-set limit `2`,
   rejected smaller limits, and checked failures for the GetBlocks budget,
   VSPC batch size, and raw anticone expression. Also reject a derived
   anticone depth above `MAX_BLUE_SCORE` and assert every accepted Catchup
   threshold is at most `MAX_DAA_SCORE`. Every rejection returns
   `InvalidConsensusParameters`, publishes no usable parameter or client
   generation, performs no default fallback, and enters no connection retry.
5. Given a fully empty `VirtualChainChanged`, NodeService drops it before
   bounded delivery with no overlap credit, processor-capacity use, or
   recovery. Distinguish it from an empty VSPC V2 RPC page.
6. VSPC V2 request construction uses `min_confirmation_count = None` and
   `data_verbosity_level = Some(RpcDataVerbosityLevel::None)`. Mocked valid
   complete-prefix and advancing-cursor responses exercise KGI's pump behavior.
   Reject a removed chain without an added path, duplicate members,
   removed/added intersection, a nonadvancing nonempty added cursor, a nonempty
   removed path whose first hash differs from `low_hash`, and any occurrence of
   `low_hash` in `added` as the corresponding `MalformedVspcResponse` reason,
   with generation retirement and no cursor advancement.
7. Mocked notification and VSPC V2 responses with a nonempty removed chain and
   an empty added path. Assert the source-specific dispositions: a notification
   reports
   `NotificationInputInvalid(MalformedVspcChange(RemovedChainWithoutAddedPath))`
   and requires Resync;
   `ValidatedRpcClient` rejects a synthetic response as
   `MalformedVspcResponse(RemovedChainWithoutAddedPath)` without returning a
   normalized change, and ResyncEngine follows the shared malformed
   recovery-response policy without dispatch or cursor advancement.
8. The subscription activation order across the
   [processing lifecycle](processing-lifecycle.md#entering-recovery-phases) and
   [NotificationRouter](node-service.md#notificationrouter): ResyncEngine alone
   sends both processor Catchup commands before invoking NodeService activation;
   NodeService sends no processor command; routing remains Disabled until both
   remote starts succeed; and callbacks received during that interval are
   dropped without overlap credit or immediate recovery.
9. Verify the
   [current pruning-point block contract](node-service.md#current-pruning-point-block)
   with success, the Genesis exception, non-Genesis parent validation, every
   listed malformed response condition, exact-generation retirement, and
   transport or generation loss without inferring a database mismatch. An
   exact-Genesis response with blue score one is
   `RecoveryInputInvalid(MalformedPruningPointResponse)`, retires the producing
   RPC generation, consumes the shared malformed-input budget, and produces no
   boundary threshold, `PreparedSync`, API Reset, or storage mutation.
10. Verify the
    [Catchup sink-sample contract](node-service.md#catchup-sink-sample) with
    ordinary and exact-Genesis success, ORIGIN, an advertised sink that is
    definitively not found, missing or malformed header data, wrong computed or
    reported hashes. Exact-Genesis success includes a representable nonzero DAA
    score. Every malformed case returns `MalformedCatchupSinkResponse`, retires
    the exact RPC generation, and consumes the shared malformed-input budget.
    Cover an out-of-range DAA score without generation retirement or budget
    consumption, transport and generation loss as session faults, and a
    distinct cancellation outcome.
11. Individual full-block GetBlock validates the requested hash and every
    `ValidatedNodeBlock` invariant. Malformed output retires the exact RPC
    generation; definitive not-found and transport failure retain their
    distinct classifications.
12. BlockAdded normalization failure disables routing, enqueues no block, and
    reports `NotificationInputInvalid(MalformedBlockAdded)` without retiring
    the RPC generation.
13. NotificationRouter applies the VSPC structural checks in their specified
    order. Exercise the valid empty no-op and each typed nonempty-removed,
    duplicate-member, and removed/added-intersection result; malformed input
    is not enqueued and disables routing without retiring the RPC generation.
14. Exercise `MAX_DAA_SCORE` and `MAX_BLUE_SCORE` successfully, then exceed
    each by one in full-block and header-only responses. Every excessive node
    value reports the corresponding `ScoreOutOfRange` fault, returns no
    normalized value, is Fatal without retiring the RPC generation, and does
    not consume the malformed recovery-response budget. Include BlockAdded,
    GetBlocks, current-pruning-point, Catchup sink-sample, and individual
    GetBlock sources. A full block timestamp of `u64::MAX` passes normalization
    unchanged and produces no timestamp-specific fault.

Use injected clocks and deterministic jitter to verify the independent
[NodeService](node-service.md#nodeservice--settled) and
[StorageService](storage.md#storageservice-lifecycle--settled) reconnect
sequences: nominal exponential slots through the 30-second cap, reset only
after 60 seconds continuously Ready, shutdown cancellation, and terminal
rejection without retry. Exercise the inclusive 50% through 100% jitter range.

## Domain, storage, and PostgreSQL

Verify the [PP boundary model](domain-model.md#pruning-point-boundary-and-origin--settled),
[persistent representation](storage.md#persistent-representation--settled),
and [rebuild transaction](storage.md#rebuild-transaction--settled) with:

1. Rebuild materializes PP at `(level = 1, slot = 0)`; retained anticone roots
   and nonroots follow the parent-derived placement rule; boundary identities
   never become block rows.
2. Genesis and any PP whose selected parent is ORIGIN retain a non-null ORIGIN
   identity without inventing a direct parent. Web Genesis detection uses the
   actual absence of direct parents rather than visible-edge absence.
3. Hash interning follows the universal five-stage order. Strict
   materialization creates no boundary identity.
4. Database startup distinguishes Uninitialized, Empty, Initialized,
   structurally inconsistent processing contents, and rejected schemas.
   Persistent `--initialize-db` is idempotent for a compatible database and
   never rebinds its network. Interactive initialization identifies the
   database and complete network binding without exposing credentials;
   noninteractive initialization requires explicit authorization. `--clear-db`
   may authorize first initialization but never claims or rebinds an existing
   incompatible schema.
5. One-shot administrative reinitialization requires explicit confirmation,
   replaces only a recognized KGI schema, binds the new Empty database to the
   validated `(network_id, genesis_hash)`, and exits. A changed declarative
   token performs the same reset once; restart with the stored token preserves
   the database. Unknown tables are never claimed or destroyed, and neither
   form can expose a partially recreated schema.
6. Advisory-lock contention rejects with `DatabaseAlreadyInUse`, and lock loss
   retires the DB generation. Compatible v2 migrations are ordered,
   transactional, revalidated, and finish before client publication. Cover
   newer-schema and v1/unsupported rejection, failed migration without client
   publication, and the prohibition on automatic down or online migration.
7. Storage may open, lock, and inspect Uninitialized contents before node
   validation, but only atomic publication of complete `NodeMetadata` crosses
   `Uninitialized -> Empty`. Inject a crash around this transaction and prove
   that no partially bound Empty state can appear.
8. Node metadata is non-null and distinguishes Empty from Genesis-anchored
   initialization despite both using `db_pp_blue_score = 0`. Reject the same
   `NetworkId` paired with a different Genesis rather than rebinding or
   rebuilding.
9. A Genesis anchor is materialized at `(1,0)`, belongs to VSPC, has ORIGIN as
   selected parent and zero actual direct parents, and has a coherent committed
   sink. Any additional boundary identity classifies processing contents as
   Inconsistent and requires Rebuild.
10. `rebuild_from_pruning_point` either publishes the complete replacement or
   leaves the previous contents intact: Compact-ID allocation restarts, the PP
   level receives its VSPC DAA score, every block row is materialized, boundary
   identities remain identity-only, and replacement caches publish only after
   definite commit. An ambiguous commit retires the DB generation without
   reporting successful Rebuild.
11. In a processing-valid database, every `blocks` row represents the semantic
    Materialized state, including retained-past closure. Ordinary processing
    performs no individual block/identity deletion or boundary-identity
    promotion; parent rows have no foreign keys or cascade semantics; merge-set
    IDs validate transactionally; and coordinate uniqueness plus `levels.size`
    updates are enforced in the insertion transaction.
12. Verify the
    [reconciliation snapshot](storage.md#reconciliation-snapshot--settled) with
    `Existing` including its Materialized `node_pp` and committed sink,
    `NodePpNotMaterialized` for absent and identity-only node pruning points,
    coherent Empty, missing or incoherent sink contents, other Inconsistent
    contents, and operational storage failure as distinct outcomes.
13. Exercise checked score conversion at zero and both domain maxima. SQL
    rejects writes outside the persisted ranges. Compatible bound contents
    with a negative score or the DAA sentinel stored as a real block score are
    classified `Inconsistent`, while a defensive out-of-range storage input is
    rejected before mutation with the typed DAA or blue
    `StorageError::ScoreOutOfRange` reason. Round-trip timestamps `0`,
    `i64::MAX`, `i64::MAX + 1`, and `u64::MAX` through the signed `BIGINT`
    bit-pattern encoding; upper-half negative storage values are not
    inconsistent contents.

Verify the [block materialization transaction](storage.md#block-materialization-transaction--settled)
and [PP seal behavior](block-processing.md#pp-boundary-phase-behavior--settled)
with an ordering fixture for a non-Genesis PP: the threshold block commits
before BlockProcessor enters PostSeal or emits `PpBoundarySealed`. For Genesis,
verify that the rebuild transaction establishes an intrinsically sealed
boundary, `BeginRebuild` enters PostSeal directly, and the same exact-once
milestone follows Begin without ordinary Genesis materialization. Inject crash
and ambiguous-commit outcomes around both paths; an unproven non-Genesis seal
emits no milestone, while restart after a committed Genesis rebuild derives
PostSeal from storage and proceeds through ordinary Resync.

Verify the rebuild pruning point establishes the Materialized base case and
every successful insertion preserves the invariant from Materialized
references or permitted boundary-identity leaves. A definite
`materialize_block` success and `BlockPresence::Materialized` dedup each
authorize `PersistedBlock`; a bare row observation, compact ID, absent hash, or
boundary identity does not. No storage mutation path may create a block row
without establishing the same invariant. Under `RequireMaterialized`, verify
one pre-mutation `NonMaterializedReferences` result reports complete, disjoint,
first-occurrence-ordered `missing` and `identity_only` arrays and rolls back all
writes and cache publication. Verify `IncomingBoundaryIdentity` precedence for
the block's own hash. Under `AllowBoundaryIdentities`, existing identity-only
references and newly absent references succeed as boundary leaves and do not
produce that strict-policy result.

For an inserted block, verify that the returned `BlockCommitted` contains the
new coordinate plus every direct parent's coordinate and level size from the
same committed transaction, with both optional fields absent for an
outside-boundary parent. `AlreadyMaterialized` returns no observer payload.
Verify BlockProcessor forwards the inserted payload before `PersistedBlock`;
failed observer delivery invalidates the API image but does not suppress the
later `PersistedBlock` delivery.

Verify the [atomic VSPC transaction](storage.md#atomic-vspc-transaction--settled)
for source continuity, every removed and added selected-parent relationship,
the removed/added pivot, direct-chain materiality, duplicate/intersection
rejection through typed pre-mutation `VspcMemberSetViolation`, source-specific
lifecycle mapping of that defensive error, typed pre-mutation
`VspcSourceDiscontinuity`, and structured
`VspcPathDiscontinuity(VspcPathConflict)` evidence, atomic membership and
coloring changes, merge-set members represented only by boundary identity, and
final level-score publication.

Verify [transaction retries](storage.md#transaction-retries) with PostgreSQL
integration fixtures. Only SQLSTATE `40001` and `40P01` retry the complete
transaction, using the nominal `10/50/250ms` slots. Assert no pre-commit cache
publication and exercise the inclusive 50% through 100% jitter range. A
nonretryable failure with proven rollback maps to `DefiniteFailure` without
retiring a still-valid generation; connection loss before commit maps to
`ServiceGenerationLost(Storage)` and retires it; connection loss with unknown
commit outcome maps to `AmbiguousCommit`, publishes no cache state, performs no
local retry, and retires it. Exercise both actual commit and rollback behind
that ambiguous result and require the replacement generation to derive the
resulting database truth. Retry exhaustion leaves the generation valid.

## Recovery lifecycle and Catchup

Verify [Resync preparation](processing-lifecycle.md#resync-preparation) with
fixtures that combine the normalized current pruning-point block, its
Materialized result, stored sink ID/hash/selected-parent hash/DAA score, and an
exact no-transactions GetBlock header. Cover:

- exact current-node-PP discovery and successful Materialized result;
- successful `MaterializedSyncAnchor` construction, including a header-only
  node block and a coherent committed Materialized sink;
- exact RPC and DB generation propagation into both processor Begin payloads,
  including VspcProcessor initialization of its committed sink and history
  seed;
- a definitively absent sink, incoherent stored sink, and a DAA mismatch
  requiring Rebuild;
- an absent or identity-only current node PP requiring Rebuild without
  retiring the valid RPC generation;
- transport or session failure without inferring Rebuild; and
- a response carrying the wrong hash or missing required GhostDAG header data
  as `MalformedGetBlock`, retiring the exact RPC generation without inferring
  Rebuild.

Verify the common
[boundary seal threshold construction](processing-lifecycle.md#boundary-seal-threshold-construction)
through both preparation modes. Cover a zero Genesis threshold, a non-Genesis
result exactly at `MAX_BLUE_SCORE`, checked-add overflow, and an otherwise
representable sum above that maximum. Both failures report
`ScoreOutOfRange(BoundarySealThreshold)` without wrapping or saturation and
produce no `PreparedSync` or processor Begin. Resync uses the reconciled DB PP
hash and score. Rebuild uses the normalized node PP hash and score and performs
this check before API Reset or database replacement. The Genesis branch returns
the constant zero from an input whose owning source has already established the
shared Genesis invariant.

Verify Rebuild obtains one normalized current pruning-point block, completes
the API Reset barrier, and passes that same `ValidatedNodeBlock` to
`rebuild_from_pruning_point` rather than rediscovering it or mixing RPC
generations. Its successful threshold and returned anchor populate the same
`PreparedSync` and exact BlockProcessor Begin payload. Malformed pruning-point
responses use the shared malformed-input budget; transport and generation loss
retain their session-fault disposition.

Also cover a coherent Genesis-anchored database below anticone finalization
depth, Empty-versus-Genesis discrimination, exact node/database
`(network_id, genesis_hash)` matching, and both synthetic streams anchored at
the committed materialized VSPC sink. Immediately after bootstrap that sink is
Genesis; after advancement it may be newer. ORIGIN must never be sent to an
RPC. A mismatch in immutable node identity is rejected rather than requesting
Rebuild.

Verify the [Catchup trigger](processing-lifecycle.md#catchup-trigger) with:

1. Initial `catchup_sink_sample()` before the GetBlocks scan and refresh only
   after holding a complete page containing the eligible marker. A failed
   initial sample starts no scan; a failed refresh leaves the held page
   undispatched, enters no Catchup, and does not replace the marker. Cover the
   malformed-sample, score-range, transport, generation-loss, and cancellation
   dispositions through their NodeService-owned typed outcomes.
2. Rolling marker replacement, replacement already present in the held page,
   cursor equality, and `Unknown -> Present -> Removed` tracking.
3. Checked and decreasing DAA-score cases and the page-aware threshold for the
   standard 1 and 10 BPS profiles and a 50 BPS override with
   `mergeset_size_limit = 512`, using the prevalidated
   `catchup_max_daa_gap`. Catchup must precede dispatch of the complete held
   page only when its VSPC-established marker satisfies the contract.
4. Independent fixtures for the global-maximum-position fallback, normalized
   GetBlocks length below three, and empty VSPC V2 page.
5. A material pre-Catchup omission using the existing strict-processing
   `Require(Resync)` path.
6. The upward seal milestone path from BlockProcessor through ResyncEngine to
   Supervisor. It never returns to BlockProcessor as a command, and no Catchup
   path is admitted before ResyncEngine observes it; global Live still requires
   PostSeal.

Verify [phase entry](processing-lifecycle.md#entering-recovery-phases),
[processor-local block overlap](block-processing.md#catchup-filtering-and-overlap),
[processor-local VSPC overlap](vspc-processing.md#catchup-filtering-crossing-and-overlap--settled),
and [global Live admission](processing-lifecycle.md#live-admission)
together. Required cases are:

1. Command priority, the Begin gate and immediate closed-gate drop, objective
   lower-bound filtering, both overlap flags, observation only at full-page
   boundaries, and Live entry while valid ordinary orphans remain.
2. Cross-response synthetic block repeats; add to the Catchup-only sent-hash
   set only after a successful enqueue and grant no overlap credit to a
   filtered repeat. This set does not participate in Live admission.
3. A temporary empty synthetic VSPC queue before component-local Live does not
   release a notification. The Live transition discards queued synthetic
   input and makes notifications authoritative for the rest of the session.
4. Notification-driven VSPC sink advancement and notification changes held in
   pre-resolution readiness by unfinished block dependencies.
5. At a complete GetBlocks-page boundary, satisfying PostSeal plus both overlap
   flags causes the lifecycle to stop and join both synthetic producers, then
   enqueue VspcProcessor Live before BlockProcessor Live and finally publish
   global Live.
6. Live admission depends only on PostSeal and both overlap flags at a complete
   page boundary, without a retained-body-tip completeness result. It makes no
   additional `GetBlockDagInfo` call for body-tip coverage, waits for no extra
   GetBlocks page, and does not inspect body-tip materiality. A dropped
   activation callback for an otherwise unobserved stale body tip neither
   blocks Live nor requests recovery.
7. An omitted block that later appears as an admitted block dependency or a
   VSPC chain member follows the existing dependency or recovery disposition.

Verify the [fault and retry policy](processing-lifecycle.md#supervisor-and-recovery-intent--settled)
with injected clocks and deterministic jitter:

- every persistence-fault row in recovery and Live, including Fatal
  `DefiniteFailure`, retained Resync and Rebuild obligations, DB-generation
  retention versus retirement, complete session teardown, and the prohibition
  on reissuing an ambiguous transaction;
- `InvalidateSession` after recoverable failure of an already-reset recovery or
  Live session: the image becomes Stale, later observer updates are rejected,
  Rebuild historical reads remain closed, and the next prepared session still
  performs its own Reset; pre-Reset and Fatal failures send no invalidation;
- whole-attempt recovery Retry rather than in-place page/RPC retry;
- the general delay sequence and 30-second cap;
- no second delay while awaiting a replacement service generation;
- the general Retry backoff resets on Live, a new resource generation, and a
  stronger obligation;
- recovery requirements do not consume Retry backoff;
- one shared counter across malformed pruning-point, Catchup sink-sample,
  GetBlock, GetBlocks, and VSPC response kinds and all VSPC reasons, including
  `RemovedChainWithoutAddedPath`, `LowHashPathMismatch`,
  `ResolvedSourceDiscontinuity`, and the later attributed
  `SelectedParentPathDiscontinuity`: each malformed synthetic
  occurrence retires its producing generation, the first three permit another
  attempt after replacement, the fourth is Fatal, replacement generations and
  stronger recovery do not reset the counter, `EnteredLive` does reset it, and
  NodeService reconnect delay is not combined with the general recovery Retry
  delay;
- a later path conflict holds the candidate and leaves the sink and cursor
  unchanged while the exact VspcProcessor RPC generation probes its child;
  exercise current-parent equality with the expected parent, stored parent, and
  neither parent, for both synthetic and notification sources;
- persisted-parent disagreement requires Rebuild without retiring a generation
  when the candidate agrees with the probe; candidate disagreement applies the
  source policy; a synthetic conflict on both sides records Rebuild, retires and
  counts the generation, while the notification form records Rebuild without
  retirement or malformed-budget consumption;
- malformed, definitively absent, transport-failed, cancelled, and
  generation-lost attribution probes retain their distinct dispositions; and
- both `BoundedStateExhausted` variants atomically reject the triggering input,
  disable both notification streams, require Resync without weakening Rebuild,
  retire no RPC generation, consume no malformed-input budget, and proceed
  through complete session teardown; and
- typed fault kinds, never diagnostics, drive policy and counters.

Verify [teardown](processing-lifecycle.md#teardown-and-delivery-semantics--settled)
by asserting that both processors' session-scoped RPC and DB clones are
released before `Deactivated`, cancellation races finish, and full versus
closed bounded channels retain their distinct dispositions.

## Block processing and dependency resolution

Verify [block admission](block-processing.md#admission-and-materialization),
[committed delivery](block-processing.md#committed-block-delivery),
[OrphanManager](block-processing.md#orphanmanager--settled), and
[DependencyResolver](block-processing.md#dependencyresolver--settled) with:

1. Reverse orphan topology releases every newly ready child.
2. Resolver pending state remains until `AddOrphan` or `BlockPersisted`.
3. Resolver cancellation and deactivation are safe with full child-result
   channels.
4. A resolver-confirmed unavailable dependency requires Rebuild, whereas RPC
   or connection failure does not establish unavailability.
5. A failed post-commit `PersistedBlock` delivery cannot be treated as a
   harmless duplicate or omission.
6. A malformed resolver full-block response retires the exact RPC generation:
   during Catchup it follows the shared malformed recovery-input budget, while
   during Live it requires Resync without consuming that budget.
7. An incoming hash already classified as a permanent boundary identity, or a
   strict materialization result containing any identity-only reference,
   reports `MaterialityViolation` and requires Rebuild without orphan or
   resolver admission. When the same result also contains absent hashes, the
   identity-only disposition takes precedence.
8. A strict missing-only result before Catchup reports
   `ReconciliationFailed` and `Require(Resync)`. During Catchup and Live, the
   complete missing set enters ordinary orphan/dependency resolution without a
   partial database write.
9. A second BlockAdded for a hash whose notification source bit is already set
   is discarded before materialization and orphan admission without changing
   overlap or requesting recovery. A synthetic copy followed by the first
   notification still establishes ordinary overlap.
10. Fill orphan storage with distinct hashes, then verify that another distinct
    orphan reports `BoundedStateExhausted(Orphans)` without partial topology,
    reverse-index, or pending-resolution mutation and accepts only lifecycle
    commands until Deactivate. Re-admitting an existing orphan at capacity
    consumes no new slot and does not report exhaustion.

## VSPC processing

Verify [change semantics](vspc-processing.md#change-semantics--settled),
[pending history](vspc-processing.md#pending-state-and-history--settled),
[readiness](vspc-processing.md#readiness-and-materiality--settled), and
[Catchup crossing](vspc-processing.md#catchup-filtering-crossing-and-overlap--settled)
with:

- removed/added source and destination derivation;
- the added-only path with no database source;
- an actionable reorg resolving `removed` followed by `added` through one
  ordered, cache-first storage batch;
- strict-`<` sink-preserving history pruning before Catchup, at the
  Catchup-to-Live transition, and during Live, with pruning disabled throughout
  Catchup;
- bounded pending order where one unready candidate does not block a later
  actionable candidate;
- pending-destination collision checks precede capacity admission; at capacity,
  an existing collision keeps its notification fault, while a distinct
  synthetic or notification candidate reports
  `BoundedStateExhausted(VspcPending)` without partial index mutation, eviction,
  or coalescing and accepts only lifecycle commands until Deactivate;
- repeated `PersistedBlock` delivery for one hash reuses the first history
  record without content comparison and leaves both history indexes unchanged;
  a new hash updates both indexes in one local transition;
- structural crossing through `added` only;
- a pending exact notification replay, a same-destination contradictory body,
  and multiple distinct actionable moves from the committed source, each with
  its typed notification fault;
- collision detection before committed-sink filtering, while a later exact
  replay after the first transition committed is a destination-equal obsolete
  discard rather than a pending-duplicate fault;
- cross-stream destination equality handled as Catchup overlap rather than a
  notification collision;
- absence of overlap credit for unresolved or filtered candidates;
- missing nonretained merge-set members at the PP boundary;
- direct nonmaterialized chain members requiring Rebuild;
- a resolved synthetic source mismatch classified as
  `ResolvedSourceDiscontinuity` rather than retained pending; and
- a storage `VspcPathDiscontinuity` held without mutation while VspcProcessor
  performs the settled source-specific attribution.

## API and Web

Verify the [graph observer feed](api.md#in-process-api-and-graph-observer-feed--settled)
and [snapshot contract](api.md#snapshot-revision-delta-sse-and-etags--settled)
for causal order, a loss flag even when the terminal message is lost,
snapshot/replay with a represented VSPC prefix, source continuity, complete
cached levels, external parent-edge endpoints and level sizes, actual parent
presence independent of visible edges, and one Reset-driven replacement
GraphEpoch per prepared processing session.

Verify [DAA navigation and graph windows](api.md#daa-navigation-and-graph-windows--settled)
for floor selection and tie break, the sentinel result, a reorg-created
VSPC-empty level, atomic level-score publication, and navigation plus window
consistency from one image. Accept zero and `MAX_DAA_SCORE` as query bounds and
reject the no-VSPC sentinel as a real DAA query.

Verify deltas and client behavior across
[API publication](api.md#snapshot-revision-delta-sse-and-etags--settled) and
[Web update acquisition](web.md#update-acquisition--settled): sequential delta
composition and expiry, response-local hash dictionaries,
`Stale -> Synchronizing -> Live`, same-epoch atomic Live revision, SSE slow
clients, fixed-view freeze, DAA focus, and Live arriving during PostSeal load.
The latter must publish the completed image directly as Live.

Verify [Reset and recovery-time availability](api.md#reset-and-recovery-time-availability--settled)
with ordinary Resync and Rebuild integration scenarios. Resync preserves
historical reads and orders Reset before PostSeal and processor Begin. Rebuild
acknowledges Reset before DB clear, closes historical reads, permits only an
old coherent in-flight result or a clean 503, and reopens reads after coherent
PostSeal publication. Include query/reset races and PostgreSQL `TRUNCATE`; no
request may observe a partial or mixed generation.

Observer and API projection tests cover a non-Genesis block whose selected
parent occurs exactly once in `direct_parents` with `is_selected = true`, plus
Genesis with an empty `direct_parents` list and no synthetic ORIGIN parent.
Genesis recognition must not require the public projection or Web client to
expose or consult persisted `NodeMetadata.genesis_hash`.

Browser graph tests cover the [Web contract](web.md): update acquisition,
fixed-view freeze and follow-live behavior, stable block identity, direct
parent rendering, and Genesis recognition from zero actual direct parents.

## Resource isolation and performance

API load tests verify the
[system isolation contract](overview.md#resource-isolation-and-scalability--settled)
and [API bulkheads](api.md#resource-isolation-and-saturation--settled).
Exercise status, head, and historical admission lanes independently, including
configured rejection limits, while measuring both processors' commit latency.
Also cover bounded slow-SSE behavior, cache-memory exhaustion with complete
levels, explicit rejection or temporary unavailability, and the required
operational measurements. Saturated API work must not materially delay
processing or produce a partial graph image.

Go KGI parity fixtures, rusty-kaspa RPC and notification fixtures, PostgreSQL
integration tests, and browser graph tests accompany the applicable groups
above.
